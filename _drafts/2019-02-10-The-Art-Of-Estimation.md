## Synopsis
Let us cut to the chase, if you came to this blog thinking you will find an aswer to estimation then let me dissappoint you straightaway, there is no such thig as best possible way to estimate. In my last 17 plus year of IT experience, estimation is the art of making an educated guess and you improve with this skill over a period of time
I plan to share my thoughts and my experience working on projects that follow different development methodology
## Estimation models

### Classic FTE model 

### T-shirt size (Complexity Model) 
You basically define the complexity buckets and map it to equivalent hours

### Story Points
This model is favored in Agile style execution. The velocity of the teams is measured sprint after sprint and total story points for a Sprint is accordingly adjusted. It is important to note that Story points do not map to work hours. In my experience, teams often remain in the mindset of mapping story points to hours and hence it is important that teams fully understand this model upfront.
This model also means that you have a management buy in to make project timeline flexible.

### Now, My Take
Irrespective of your projects SDLC model, every project has a fixed time and budget or in other words, Wheather you follow Agile [https://www.agilealliance.org/](https://www.agilealliance.org/), Scaled Agile [https://www.scaledagile.com/](https://www.scaledagile.com/) or classic waterfall model, No management will ever let you run with a project that has no timeline and budget defined upfront. intersetingly, the contractual models for projects are still based on capacity time.

#### Fixed time fixed price
Project delivery and quality risk is owned by the delivery teams
Delivery team may still be expected to execute the project in Agile fashion
Go with this model only if requirements are well defined and there are minimum risks with regards to external project dependencies

#### Time and Material
Majority of the the delivery risk is owned by the client
Product quality is owned by the delivery teams
