## Synopsis
[https://locust.io/](https://locust.io/)
[https://jmeter.apache.org/](https://jmeter.apache.org/)

I have been a long time user of Jmeter and works really great when you have a team of non coders wanting to record test scripts.
If you are someone looking for script recording tool then you should immediately drop the idea of using Locust, as Locust does not support script recoring as of this writing.

Locust on the other hand is all about coding. You got to have basic python experience to write load scripts. I guess the good news is Python is fast becoming
a mandatory skillset for every engineer and it is not difficult to script and run locust.

Locust also fits nicely into the shift left performance test model. wherein, the development team writes the component level performance test scripts at the time 
of building the functionality.
