## Synopsis
I have heard a lot about Kotlin in the past but never got an opportunity to work with it on any of my projects. All this changed recently when I started working on a Mobile app centric project. so, I decided to get my hands dirty with Kotlin. I have extensive experience working on Java and have never been convinced to explore functional programming because of my addiction to Java

## Introduction
Let's start with a HelloWorld Pg.

HelloWorld.java
``` java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("Say Hello");
    }
}
```

HelloWorld.kt
``` kotlin
fun main(): Unit {
    println("Say Hello")
}
```
