title: My First Encounter    with Kotlin
date: 2019-02-02

## Synopsis
I have heard a lot about Kotlin in the past but never got an opportunity to work with it on any of my projects. All this changed recently when I started working on a Mobile app centric project. so, I decided to get my hands dirty with Kotlin. I have extensive experience working on Java and have never been convinced to explore functional programming because of my addiction to Java

## Introduction
Let's start with a HelloWorld Pg.

HelloWorld.java
``` java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("Say Hello");
    }
}
```

HelloWorld.kt
``` kotlin
fun main(): Unit {
    println("Say Hello")
}
```

Java Bean Example

Employee.java
``` java
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private String phone;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getPhone() {
        return phone;
    }

    public void setPhone(String phone) {
        this.phone = phone;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{" +
                "name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", phone='" + phone + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}
```

Employee.kt
``` kotlin
data class Employee (val name:String, val phone:String)
```
``` java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        emp.setName("Emp1");
        emp.setPhone("222-999-222");

        System.out.println("Employee Name is " + emp.getName() + " and Phone No. is " + emp.getPhone());
    }
}
```
``` kotlin
fun main(): Unit {
    val emp = Employee("Emp1", "222-999-222")
    val(name, phone) = emp
    println("Employee Name is $name and Phone No. is $phone")
}
```
