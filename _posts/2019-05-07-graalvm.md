## Introduction
Oracle recently announced the production ready 1.0 release of GraalVM. If you have not been following the developments around the polyglot VM offering from Oracle here is a good resource from Oracle [Oracle Blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/announcing-graalvm)

## Installation
Download the preferred version from [Download GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/). For this tutorial, I shall be using the open source version from [here](https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases)
Next, we will install the native-image tool to create a native binary.

> gu install native-image

### HelloWorld Example

``` java
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Compile the Kotlin code
> kotlinc Hello.kt

Run the code
> kotlin HelloKt

Now, to generate the native executable, we first need to generate a jar
> kotlinc Hello.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar

Lastly, we need to run this command to generate the native executable
> native-image -jar hello.jar

This should generate a native executable in your current folder.
